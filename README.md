# diabetes-prediction-ml
This project applies multiple machine learning models to predict the likelihood of diabetes in patients based on health-related features. The goal was to compare different algorithms, tune hyperparameters, and evaluate performance using metrics such as **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, and ROC AUC**.
